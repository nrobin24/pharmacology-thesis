### 1.2.2 Understanding Biological Mechanisms through Cell Signaling Events

The projects that I participated in attempted to further our understanding of  cell behavior. In each case I used Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling as an entry point from which to address biological mechanisms that govern behavior. This entailed selectively monitoring and perturbing Wnt signling. I monitored Wnt signaling while using established methods to perturb other pathways, in order to find where multiple pathways may cross-talk with one another. To determine the role of Wnt in homeostatic and disease processes, I perturbed Wnt signaling while monitoring behaviors such as cell death, proliferation, induction of differentiation, and lineage specification.

I chose to focus on Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in part because of its established role in diseases including melanoma and various neurodegenerative disorders. This helped to guide the direction in which I proceeded through projects, as I was able to place my experimental results within context of the body of knowledge about the specific disease.

In spite of what is known about how misregulated Wnt/ß-catenin signaling can precipitate disease states, there are relatively few therapies targetting this signaling pathway. This served as another reason that I focused on this pathway.
