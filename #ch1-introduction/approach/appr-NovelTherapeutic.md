### 1.2.3 Exploiting Cell Signaling to Inform Novel Therapeutics

The idea of targeting pathways in disease has been around for a while

There were certain successes, particularly in cancer, see Gleevec

However cancer is fast moving and changing, see Vemurafinib

A new idea is to target cancer stem cells with Wnt

Why? Wnt has less functional redundancy than ERK/MAPK

An aim of my work was to identify opportunites where perturbation of cell signaling in stem and progenitor cells may inform the development of a rational therapeutic.

This approach worked in my projects where:

with ril and simva we already knew something about targets

with WIKI we were able to connect to known mechanism

later on with BRAF, Wnt was able to synergize w vemurafinib

<!-- Stem Cells -->
To date, the field of translational life sciences has made major headway towards development of therapies that utilize pharmacologic manipulation of stem and progenitor cells.
