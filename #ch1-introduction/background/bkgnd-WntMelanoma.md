<!-- Cancer Stem Cell -->
Misregulation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to various types of tumors. The 'cancer stem cell' hypothesis holds that the same pathways regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and that there are stem cells within the tumor that posess indefinite potential for self-renewal.
