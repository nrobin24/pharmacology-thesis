### 1.1.3 - Pharmacologic regulators of Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling

Currently there are no clinically approved therapies that specifically target Wnt signaling. [Zimmerman et al.] This is in spite of the fact that misregulation of the pathway has a well known role in cancer and degenerative diseases. 

Lithium is in clinical use and part of its mechanism may be due to Wnt signaling. This is talked about in my Simva paper.

Difficulties include: progenitor cell populations like in the intestine and in germinal regions of the brain require Wnt signaling, so inhibiting the pathway in order to block growth of a cancer with activated Wnt may be too harmful to other tissues. [@Watanabe_Dai_2011] Another problem is that GSK3, which is a kinase and thus relatively easier to target with small molecules, is also integral to AKT signaling and performs an additional function in synthesizing glycogen. [@TakahashiYanaga2013191]

There are now multiple compounds under pre-clinical investigation.
