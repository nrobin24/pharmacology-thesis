### 1.1.3 - Pharmacologic regulators of Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling

We have relatively few tools to modify Wnt signaling both experimentally and therapeutically. See points raised in Zimmerman et al.

Lithium is in clinical use and part of its mechanism may be due to Wnt signaling. This is talked about in my Simva paper.

Multiple compounds under pre-clinical investigation.
