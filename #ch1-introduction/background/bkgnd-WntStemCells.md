### 1.1.2 - Wnt/ß-Catenin Signaling in Stem Cells

#### Wnt Regulation of Devloping Tissues

Wnts are a family of roughly 20 secreted glycoproteins, that are ligands for Fzd receptors. Wnts were first discovered based on their role in cell polarity in Drosophila and axis induction in Xenopus during organism development. Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, also referred to as canonical Wnt signaling, involves the acumulation of ß-catenin in the cytosol subsequent to membrane receptor activation. ß-catenin is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds a set of transcription factors, ultimately driving expression of various target genes. In contrast, ß-catenin independent, or non-canonical, Wnt signaling is thought not to direct gene expression.

In the ensuing decades since the discovery of this signaling pathway, Wnt has been determined to play a central part in most aspects of embryonic development as well as in the homeostasis of some adult tissues [@Clevers2006469]. A commonality between these adult tissues, which include the colon crypts and germinal brain regions, is the presence of stem cell niches. Involvement of Wnt signaling is also implicated in certain tissues during disease, a notable example is cancer tumorogenesis.

#### Wnt in Cancer Tumorogenesis

<!-- Cancer Stem Cell -->
Misregulation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to various types of tumors. The 'cancer stem cell' hypothesis holds that the same pathways regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and that there are stem cells within the tumor that posess indefinite potential for self-renewal.
