### 1.1.2 - Wnt/ß-Catenin Signaling in Stem Cells

#### Wnt Regulation of Developing Tissues

Wnts are a family of roughly 20 secreted glycoproteins, that are ligands for Fzd receptors. Wnts were first discovered based on their role in cell polarity in Drosophila and axis induction in Xenopus during organism development. Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, also referred to as canonical Wnt signaling, involves the accumulation of ß-catenin in the cytosol subsequent to membrane receptor activation. ß-catenin is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds a set of transcription factors, ultimately driving expression of various target genes. In contrast, ß-catenin independent, or non-canonical, Wnt signaling is thought not to direct gene expression.

In the ensuing decades since the discovery of this signaling pathway, Wnt has been determined to play a central part in most aspects of embryonic development as well as in the homeostasis of some adult tissues [@Clevers2006469]. A commonality between these adult tissues, which include the colon crypts and germinal brain regions, is the presence of stem cell niches. Involvement of Wnt signaling is also implicated in certain tissues during disease, a notable example is cancer tumorigenesis.

#### Wnt in Cancer Tumorigenesis

<!-- Cancer Stem Cell -->
Misregulation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to various types of tumors. The 'cancer stem cell' hypothesis holds that the same pathways regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and that there are stem cells within the tumor that possess indefinite potential for self-renewal. [Tannishtha Reya. Nature 2001]

Different tumors have found to have Wnt signaling component. Colorectal cancer is linked to activating APC mutations. Melanoma through XXX. Breast cancer thru XXX. Willms tumor is linked to WTX. Glioblastoma is linked through ??. Also renal cell, non small cell lung cancer, ec.

It is not always over-activation that causes cancer. In melanoma patients activating the pathway is beneficial. Altho this may be time dependent.

#### Wnt in Adult Neurogenesis

It was discovered in X that there are populations of adult neural progenitor cells that reside in the brain and contribute new functioning neurons throughout adulthood. Wnt was discovered to be a key regulator of adult neurogenesis by Fred Gage's lab.

Secreted negative regulators of Wnt signaling increase throughout adulthood, and this correlates with reduction in neurogenesis.

Mutations in genes that regulate  Wnt signaling in the brain (DISC1, DIXDC1) are linked with schizophrenia and major depression.

#### Wnt in hESCs

There is a controversy as to the specific role of canonical signaling.

The existence of this controversy means that we should study the Wnt pathway in hESCs more closely and try to learn more about the specific mechanisms.

The controversy also speaks to the complexity of hESC culture, where results can often conflict with mouse ESCs, and also multiple signaling pathways are highly dependant upon one another.

"Thus, heterogeneity with respect to endogenous Wnt signalling underlies much of the inefficiency in directing hESCs towards specific cell types. The relatively uniform differentiation potential of the Wnt(high) and Wnt(low) hESCs leads to faster and more efficient derivation of targeted cell types from these populations."
