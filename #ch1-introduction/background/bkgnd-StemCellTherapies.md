#### Properties of Stem Cells

We know in large part where stem and progenitor cell niches reside within adult organisms. We have identified cases where these niches contribute to homeostasis or disease depending on their environment. We have identified sets of markers that reliably indicate where a cell lies within the spectrum between pluripotency and terminal differentiation, and this information can be used to determine the fate decisions that a cell has made in its lifetime. These advances have greatly impacted our understanding of the mechanisms by which dysregulation of signaling in stem cells contributes to disease.

Additionally, the field possesses an increasingly rich understanding of how stem cells may manipulated to generate desired cell types, and conversely how to induce differentiated cells to gain pluripotent capability.

#### Cancer Stem Cells

The 'cancer stem cell' hypothesis holds that the same pathways regulate self-renewal in stem cells and cancer cells, and that there are stem cells within the tumor that posess indefinite potential for self-renewal. [Tannishtha Reya. Nature 2001]
