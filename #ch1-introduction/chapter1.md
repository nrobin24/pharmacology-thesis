### 1.1.1 - Stem Cell Signaling and Disease

Stem cells are cells that divide both symmetrically and asymmetrically. This means that populations of stem cells posses the capabilities for self renewal, as well as producuction of  differentiated cell types of various lineages [@Basics_2009]. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reside within developing human embryos and are pluripotent. This means that hESCs can differentiate into any of three germ layers, and ultimately are capable of yielding any of the cell types found in the body. In addition to embryonic stem cells, there are stem cells which reside in certain tissues during adulthood. These cells may be lineage restricted (multipotent), as opposed to pluripotent. Adult stem cells are also called somatic stem cells, and there are specific populations which are referred to as progenitor cells [@Young_2004]. Adult stem cells are responisble for maintaining homeostasis in tissues. This is especially the case in areas with rapid cell turnover such as bone, hematopoetic tissue, hair folicles, and intestinal crypts [@Potten_1998 @Morris_2004].

Stem cell populations in both developing and adult organisms are sometimes found within specialized subcompartments called niches [@Scadden_2006]. Stem cell niches house stem cells as well as supporting cells. Supporting cells within niches are responsible for providing nutrients to stem cells, and also can provide signals that guide stem cell behaviors. Among these behaviors are proliferation, induction of differentiation, and lineage specification. At any given time, the mixture of signaling molecules present in the niche microenvironment guides stem cell behavior and effects the identity and rate of new cells [@Morrison_2008].

Although we posses only a partial understanding of how these signals are integrated to regulate key behaviors in stem cells, it is clear that when signaling becomes misregulated there are often deleterious effects. Alterations in proliferation and differentiation that are caused by genetic or environmental factors contribute to the pathology of a number of diseases. In cases where a cell type that is necessary for maintaining healthy tissue is no longer produced, tissue degeneration can occur. Alternately, stem cell proliferation gone unchecked may spur tumorigenesis. A subfield of cancer biology has formed to investigate the hypothesis of cancer stem cells [@Reya_2001]. This hypothesis holds that there are stem cells within a tumor that possess indefinite potential for self-renewal, and that the same pathways regulating self-renewal in normal stem cells have similar roles in cancer stem cells. 

Given the importance of signaling molecules in guiding stem cells towards either healthy or disease phenotypes, a major goal of current research is to better understand the signals that influence stem cell decisions. This may aid in development of novel therapies for these diseases. Moreover, if we possess pharmacological tools to direct stem cell behavior it may be possible to repair diseased tissue using cells derived from the patient or a donor.

### 1.1.2 - Wnt/ß-Catenin Signaling in Stem Cells

Wnts are a family of secreted glycoproteins that act as ligands for Fzd transmembrane receptors [@Clevers2006469]. Wnts were first discovered for their ability to regulate cell polarity in Drosophila and to induce body axes in Xenopus during development [@Chien_2009_Rev]. Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, which is referred to as canonical Wnt signaling, involves the accumulation of ß-catenin protein in the cytosol following membrane receptor activation by canonical Wnt ligands. ß-catenin is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds a set of transcription factors, ultimately driving expression of various target genes. [@Angers_2009] In contrast, ß-catenin independent, or non-canonical, Wnt signaling is thought not to direct gene expression.[^WntNote] In the ensuing decades since the discovery of this signaling pathway, Wnt has been determined to play a central part in most aspects of embryonic development as well as in the homeostasis of adult tissues. 

[^WntNote]: The main focus of this thesis is on Wnt/ß-Cantenin signaling, and unless otherwise noted 'Wnt/ß-Catenin' may heretofore be used interchangibly with 'Wnt' within this text.

### 1.1.3 - Wnt in Cancer Tumorigenesis

Misregulation of the Wnt pathway has been linked to the formation of various types of tumors. A well studied example of this is in colorectal cancer, where mutations in the gene _APC_ are the most frequent cause [@Clevers_1997]. APC is one of the proteins responsible for degrading ß-Catenin when the pathway is not active. When APC cannot function there is an abnormally high level of Wnt signaling that causes overexpression of growth promoting genes [@Najdi_2011]. Mutations in other core Wnt pathay genes _AXIN1_, _CTNNB1_, and _TCF7L2_ have been linked to tumor formation [@Anastas_2013]. Abberations in Wnt signaling have been identified as contributing to pancreatic, mammary, ovarian, and skin cancers.

In melanoma, as opposed to colorectal cancer, a high level of Wnt signaling was found to correlate with improved patient survival [@chien2009activated]. Melanoma tumors are commonly caused by mutations in the ERK signaling pathway, the most frequently observed being BRAF V600E mutation. It was discovered that Wnt has a high level of crosstalk with hyperactivated ERK signaling in melanoma cells [@biechele2012wnt]. It should also be noted that a high level of Wnt/ß catenin signaling has been found to be induce tumorigenesis and metastasis in melanomas dependent on mutational status [@Delmas_2007 @Damsky_2011].

A more in depth explanation of Wnt in melanoma is included in chapter 2 of this thesis.

### 1.1.4 - Wnt in cultured hESCs

Wnt governs the transition between self renewal and spontaneous differentiation in hESCs. It was initially reported that active endogenous Wnt signaling is necessary for embryonic stem cells to maintain an undifferentiated state [@Sato_2004]. However, this finding was later determined to be specific to culture conditions used in the study. Endogenous Wnt signaling has since been shown to be dispensible for self-renewal, while activation of the pahtway with exogenous Wnt lead cells to undergo spontaneous differentiation [@davidson2012wnt]. The conflicted nature of htese findings speaks to the complexity of hESC culture, where multiple signaling pathways are highly dependant upon one another.

"Thus, heterogeneity with respect to endogenous Wnt signalling underlies much of the inefficiency in directing hESCs towards specific cell types. The relatively uniform differentiation potential of the Wnt(high) and Wnt(low) hESCs leads to faster and more efficient derivation of targeted cell types from these populations."

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22990866

Efforts to control when and how hESCs differentiate in culture are central to a number of novel therapeutic strategies. The development of protocols for directed hESC differentiaton is an active area of research. Directed differentiation protocols where Wnt is manipulated are being considered in order to produce myocardial cells [Murry Lab], hematopoetic cells [Hadland]. These protocols require both the knowledge of how Wnt controls differentiation, and tools that can be used to specifically and temporally regulate the pathway. 

The effects of Wnt signaling on hESC differentiation is discussed in chapter 3 of this thesis.

### 1.1.5 - Wnt in Adult Neurogenesis

Until the 1990s it was not widely accepted that cells continue to divide throughout adulthood in mammalian brains. This changed when number of studies using cell cycle markers identified dividing progenitor populations that reside in the certain brain regions and generate new functioning neurons in multiple animal models [@Gage_2002]. As with other adult stem cell populations, depletion or damage to adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) was found to contribute to disease. For instance, following traumatic brain injury, a drop in aNPC population is linked with outcomes like post traumatic stress disorder and memory loss. Genetic factors that negatively effect adult neurogenesis contribute to the etiology of various CNS disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Schizophrenia [@Reif_2006 @Brinton_2006]. 

Wnt was discovered to be a key regulator of adult neurogenesis by Fred Gage's lab. The Wnt/ß-catenin pathway is a key regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.  Hippocampal neurogenesis is blocked in adult rats by a dominant-negative WNT, which leads to deficits in spatial and object recognition memory [7]. Conversely, enhanced Wnt/ß-catenin signaling is sufficient to increase production of neurons from adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) [8]. Secreted negative regulators of Wnt signaling increase throughout adulthood, and this correlates with reduction in neurogenesis. [Song]

Mutations in genes that regulate  Wnt signaling in the brain (DISC1, DIXDC1) are linked with schizophrenia and major depression.

A more detailed account of Wnt in adult neurogenesis is presented in chapter 4 of this thesis.

### 1.1.6 - Pharmacologic regulators of Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling

In spite of the fact that misregulation of the Wnt pathway has a well known role in cancer and degenerative diseases, there currently are no clinically approved therapies that specifically target Wnt signaling [@zimmerman2012targeting]. However, promisingly there are multiple such compounds currently undergoing clinical trials [@Hitt_2013].

There are numerous difficulties that have stood in the way of progress towards developing Wnt targeted drugs. For one, progenitor cell populations like in the intestine and in germinal regions of the brain require Wnt signaling, so inhibiting the pathway in order to block growth of a cancer with activated Wnt can be too harmful to other tissues for clinical feasibility [@Watanabe_Dai_2011]. Another problem is the interconnectedness of Wnt pathway components with other signaling pathways. For instance GSK3, which is a kinase and thus relatively easier to target with small molecules, is also integral to AKT signaling and performs an additional function in synthesizing glycogen [@TakahashiYanaga2013191].

Chapters 2-4 of this manuscript each discuss pharmacologic regulators of the Wnt pathway.

## 1.2 Approach

### 1.2.1 Discovering Small Molecule Regulators of Wnt/ß-Catenin Signaling

In the research presented in chapters 2-4, I looked to discover small molecule regulators of the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. I was particularly interested in small molecules because of their applicability to both basic research and clinical drug development. As opposed to genetic approaches such as siRNAs and shRNAs to induce a gain or loss of function in cell signaling, small molecules can be included in an experimental paradigm with relatively little overhead and higher relative predictability of effect [@Weiss_2007]. This effect carries over when administering small molecules to animals, which tends to be more efficacious than genetic materials. Although delivery of RNAi molecules in vivo is possible, studies employing this method have relied upon sophisticated techniques and instrumentation [@Beronja_2010]. Finally, small molecules have a long proven track record in treating human diseases.

Consistent with my overall goals, small molecules are highly amenable to discovery via automation. The use of arrayed libraries in microplates allows for high-throughput screens to be performed by automated equipment, rather than being tested individually by hand [@Sundberg_2000]. These contents of the libraries can be produced from curated lists, such as the library of human experienced compounds in the riluzole in simvastatin papers. Libraries can also be produced combinatorially around a scaffold or particular pharmacophore [@Thompson_1996].

Another reason that I prioritized the discovery of small molecule regulators of Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling is that the small molecules that I reported on serve as deliverables in and of themselves alongside the journal articles. This means that future projects have a reliable physical starting place from which to conduct experiments. The molecules discussed in these works are commercially available, and in some cases are already approved for human use. This means that the time it takes for another group to begin experiments based off of my findings will be minimized, and ongoing studies of these molecules such as in clinical trials will be able to draw inference from my projects.

### 1.2.2 Understanding Biological Mechanisms through Cell Signaling Events

The projects that I participated in attempted to further our understanding of the mechanisms of cell signaling. In each case I used Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling as an entry point from which to address biological mechanisms that govern behavior. This entailed selectively monitoring and perturbing Wnt signaling. In order to monitor the pathway I made user of genetic reporter constructs whose expression are driven by nuclear ß-Catenin, including pBAR in cultured cells [@Biechele_2008] and BAT-GAL in mice [@Maretto_2003]. To determine the role of Wnt in homeostatic and disease processes, I perturbed Wnt signaling while monitoring behaviors such as cell death, proliferation, induction of differentiation, and lineage specification.

Part of the reason for the lack of Wnt pathway directed drugs is the need for more feasible drug targets. To increase this number, we may discover additional protein regulators of the pathway. To this end, I monitored Wnt signaling while using established methods to perturb other pathways, in order to find where multiple pathways may cross-talk with one another. In screening small molecules we sought to discover novel drug targets. In the work presented in chapters 2 and 4, we attempted to map the previously unkown connections between drug targets HMGCR and GRM1, and the Wnt signaling pathway. In chapter 3 of this thesis, we determined that the molecule under investigation acted through a recently discovered mechanism of Wnt inhibition.

### 1.2.3 Exploiting Cell Signaling to Inform Novel Therapeutics

As a natural complement to learning about the role of Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling in disease and discovery of small molecules, an aim of my work was to gather pieces of pre-clinical evidence. This meant identifying opportunities where perturbation of Wnt signaling in stem and progenitor cells may inform the development of rational therapeutics.


The rescue or repurposing of drugs that have already passed through human safety studies has been widely discussed as a strategy that may succesfully speed up development of therapies. Chapters 2 and 4 of this thesis present investigation of previously undocumented effects FDA approved compounds.
