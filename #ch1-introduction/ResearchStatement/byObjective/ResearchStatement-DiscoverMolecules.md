<!--        Clearly state OBJECTIVE -->
An aim of my work was to discover molecular regulators of key signaling events with applications to both basic research and clinical drug development.

<!--    Why is OBJECTIVE worth focusing on -->
This feeds into both of the other objectives. 

Small molecules have a track record of succesful therapeutics.

<!-- Where is the field at in terms of accomplishing OBJECTIVE -->
Lots of small molecule high throughput screening. 

<!-- What unique hurdles does OBJECTIVE present -->
Assays aren't expressive enough to capture complex phenotypes.

It's hard to screen in disease relevant contexts.

Hits in primary screen rarely make it through validation in disease models.

<!-- How does my approach attempt to address hurdles -->
Libraries of known bioactive compounds. Focus on repurposing FDA approved drugs.
