### 1.1.2 Understaning Biological Mechanisms through Cell Signaling Events

The projects that I participated in attempted to further our understanding of  cell behavior. In each case I used Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling as an entrypoint from which to address biological mechanisms that govern behavior. This entailed selectively monitoring and perturbing Wnt signlaing. I monitored Wnt signaling while using established methods to perturb other pathways, in order to find where multiple pathways may cross-talk with one another. To determine the role of Wnt in homeostatic and disease processes, I perturbed Wnt signaling while monitoring behaviors such as cell death, proliferation, induction of differentiation, and lineage specifcation.

I chose to focus on Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in part because of its established role in diseases including melanoma and various neurodegenerative disorders. This helped to guide the direction in which I proceeded through projects, as I was able to place my experimental results within context of the body of knowledge about the specific disease.

In spite of what is known about how misregulated Wnt/ß-catenin signaling can precipitate disease states, there are relatively few therapies targetting this signaling pathway. This served as another reason that I focused on this pathway. 




<!--    Why is OBJECTIVE worth focusing on -->
The behavior of stem cell populations lies at the center of various diseases.

These diseases include melanoma and neurodegenerative disorders.

<!-- Where is the field at in terms of accomplishing OBJECTIVE -->
We have learned how to differentiate down various lineages.

We have learned how to reprogram towards pluripotency.

We can generate various disease relevant tissue types.

<!-- What unique hurdles does OBJECTIVE present -->
Stem cell culture can be relatively difficult.

Learning about differentation requires tracking cells as they change their identity.

Stem cells exist in niches, and so must be considered as a complex population.

<!-- How does my approach attempt to address hurdles -->
Automate experiments with stem cells by overcoming culture limitations.

<!-- What is my unique contribution to the field in attempting to accomplish OBJECTIVE -->
Proof of concept for HTS in hESCs.

Automated analysis to correlate cell type specific markers with cell signaling events.
