### 1.1.2 Determining Relationships Between Biological Mechanisms and Cell Signaling Events

<!--        Clearly state OBJECTIVE -->
An aim of my work was to elucidate the role of signaling pathways in governing stem cell behaviors like differentiation and programmed death.

<!--    Why is OBJECTIVE worth focusing on -->
The behavior of stem cell populations lies at the center of various diseases.

These diseases include melanoma and neurodegenerative disorders.

<!-- Where is the field at in terms of accomplishing OBJECTIVE -->
We have learned how to differentiate down various lineages.

We have learned how to reprogram towards pluripotency.

We can generate various disease relevant tissue types.

<!-- What unique hurdles does OBJECTIVE present -->
Stem cell culture can be relatively difficult.

Learning about differentation requires tracking cells as they change their identity.

Stem cells exist in niches, and so must be considered as a complex population.

<!-- How does my approach attempt to address hurdles -->
Automate experiments with stem cells by overcoming culture limitations.

<!-- What is my unique contribution to the field in attempting to accomplish OBJECTIVE -->
Proof of concept for HTS in hESCs.

Automated analysis to correlate cell type specific markers with cell signaling events.
