I conducted the research presented in this thesis dissertation with the goal of elucidating how Wnt/ß-catenin signaling directs behavior in stem and progenitor cells. Within this realm, I chose to investigate contexts in which findings may inform novel therapeutics. From project to project, I looked to maximize the amount of usable information gathered, and to optimize relevance to disease using experimental models.

To accomplish the above goals, I worked with a pattern which was iteratively improved upon. Projects began with a high-throughput screen to discover molecules that regulate Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in decidedly interesting contexts. The molecules with the greatest activity in the screen are chosen as hits, and are fed into a pipeline of validation steps that served to filter out false-positives. Finally, I characterized the activity of the remaining true-positive hit molecules in a series of cell culture, animal, and disease models.
