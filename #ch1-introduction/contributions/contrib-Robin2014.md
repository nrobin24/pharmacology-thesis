### 1.3.3 - Robin et. al, 2014

I did this entire project myself, basically.

* I identified that statins would be an interesting hit to follow up on from the small molecule screen
* I generated a reporter cell line from primary aNPCs, and validated simvastatin in this line
* I ran RT-PCR as a secondary confirmation that simvastatin enhances WNt
* I treated differentiatin aNPCs with simvastatin and stained for cell type specific markers, revealing that simvastain drives cell fate towards neuronal lineage
* I treated mice with simvastatin and observed an increased number of batgal positive cells in the DG
* I looked at cell type specific markers in the DG and saw that simvastatin treatment enhances adult neurogenesis
* I treated reporter cells with various metabolites from the HMGCR pathway and determined that simvastatin enhances WNT signaling by depleting isoprenoids
