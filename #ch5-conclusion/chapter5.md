### 5.1 - Summary of Results

The journal articles covered in this thesis are connected in their approach and goals. Projects began with a high-throughput screen to discover molecules that regulate Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in decidedly interesting contexts. The molecules with the greatest activity in the screen were chosen as hits, and were fed into a pipeline of filtering and validation steps. Finally, the activity of the most promising molecules was characterized in a series of cell culture, animal, and disease models. From project to project, this was pattern iteratively improved upon. I looked to maximize the amount of usable information gathered, and to optimize relevance to disease using experimental models.

My contribution of original knowledge in the field of tranlational stem cell biology is the discovery of various molecules that can be used to manipulate Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling. This includes repurposed clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, and novel compounds whose biological mechanisms were later determined. In addition I developed methods that can be used for conducting large scale screens and for performing automated experiments with stem and progenitor cells.

### 5.2 - Successes 

The central theme of the Moon Lab is Wnt signaling. This influenced the direction of my research such as in deciding which primary screen hits I deemed most interesting for follow up, and which types of libraries to screen. I found that throughout the course of my research, there was a significant benefit to my progress by focusing specifically on Wnt signaling. There was a synergistic effect of having, in house, a well curated set of reagents and a wealth of human expertise on the subject of Wnt signaling. Notably, I was able to use the BAR construct as a first line of discovery in a diverse set of contexts. 

The focus on discovery of small molecules means that alongside each publication presented in this thesis there is a tangible molecular entity. The small molecules that we reported on reliably elicit an effect, are widely available, and are relatively inexpensive. In the case of WIKI4, where we identified a Wnt inhibitor from among a large set of novel compounds, this molecule is now commercially available alongside other Wnt inhibitors [Tocris Link]. As such, researchers looking to reproduce or build upon our findings will not have to rely upon proprietary formulations or methodologies. Futher, clinicians investigating the therapeutic effects of the human experienced drugs that we investigated may be able to contextualize findings with the biological mechanisms that we reported. These, in sum, bolster the impact of the projects that I worked on.

### 5.3  - Shortcomings

Aside from the benefits discussed above, chosing to investigate biological mechanisms and disease through the lens of a single signaling pathway imposes some difficulties in research. It is common that mechanisms contributing to the pathology of a disease span indiscriminately across signaling pathways. We found this to be the case in our investigation of melanoma, presented in this thesis and in follow up studies, where ERK signaling and Wnt signaling both play crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival.

While at times the self imposed filter of small molecules was helpful, it also restricted the possible solutions that could be found for a problem

Likewise with Wnt signaling, aside from the gains of tying a research project to a particular pathway, its likely that disease pathologies span indiscriminately across signaling pathways. It may be more beneficial in some cases to consider all signaling pathways simultaneously, as is the case in systems biology, as opposed to 'monolithic' focus on a known pathway.

A shortcoming of my work with small molecules was my relative inability to determine novel targets. With Riluzole, we were fairly certain that the effect was due to metabotropic glutamate receptor, but there was conflicting data. In the case of the WIKI paper, Ricker worked for a long time and barely found it -- and it was already known. In the case of the simvastatin, I was able to confirm that the effect on Wnt was due to simvas known MOA, but when I attempted to trace the steps back to Wnt signaling I could not successfully connect the dots with small molecules alone.

Although I gave some attempt at using genetic and proteomic approaches, these did not yield an answer. I believe that if I had focused more strongly on possessing the correct genetic and proteomic tools to monitor and manipulate Wnt signaling I could have learned the answer -- and would be more suited to answer future questions.

Despite the effort put forth to do HTS in stem cells, we did not identify anything unique to stem cells when we did these screens. Wiki works in other cell types, as do the peptide mimetics that I identified. We hoped to learn about a possible interaction between CTNNB1 and OCT4, but only in traditional low-throughput experiments was our lab able to address these questions. The mistake here was to perform a holistic discovery experiment with an anticipated result in mind -- these two approaches are not compatible.

### 5.4 - Suggestions for future work

Determine whether wnt enhancement can truly overcome vemurafenib resistance

Closely follow clinical paradigms -- if something aside from small molecules comes along, then quickly adopt it to research

Prioritize performing experiments from different domains in tandem. In order to build a strong case that a certain signaling event occurs, I found that it is not only necessary to use small molecule perturbation but also through genetic means such as siRNA.
