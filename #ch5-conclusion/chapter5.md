## 5.1 - Summary of Results

The journal articles covered in this thesis are connected in their approach and goals. Projects began with a high-throughput screen to discover molecules that regulate Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in decidedly interesting contexts. The molecules with the greatest activity in the screen were chosen as hits, and were fed into a pipeline of filtering and validation steps. Finally, the activity of the most promising molecules was characterized in a series of cell culture, animal, and disease models. From project to project, this was pattern iteratively improved upon. I looked to maximize the amount of usable information gathered, and to optimize relevance to disease using experimental models.

My contribution of original knowledge in the field of tranlational stem cell biology is the discovery of various molecules that can be used to manipulate Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling. This includes repurposed clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, and novel compounds whose biological mechanisms were later determined. In addition I developed methods that can be used for conducting large scale screens and for performing automated experiments with stem and progenitor cells.

## 5.2 - Successes of my Approach

The central theme of the Moon Lab is Wnt signaling. This influenced the direction of my research such as in deciding which primary screen hits I deemed most interesting for follow up, and which types of libraries to screen. I found that throughout the course of my research, there was a significant benefit to my progress by focusing specifically on Wnt signaling. There was a synergistic effect of having, in house, a well curated set of reagents and a wealth of human expertise on the subject of Wnt signaling. Notably, I was able to use the BAR construct as a first line of discovery in a diverse set of contexts. 

The focus on discovery of small molecules means that alongside each publication presented in this thesis there is a tangible molecular entity. The small molecules that we reported on reliably elicit an effect, are widely available, and are relatively inexpensive. In the case of WIKI4, where we identified a Wnt inhibitor from among a large set of novel compounds, this molecule is now commercially available alongside other Wnt inhibitors [@Tocris_Wiki4]. As such, researchers looking to reproduce or build upon our findings will not have to rely upon proprietary formulations or methodologies. Futher, clinicians investigating the therapeutic effects of riluzole or simvastatin may be able to contextualize their own findings with the biological mechanisms that we reported. These, in sum, bolster the impact of the projects that I worked on.

## 5.3  - Shortcomings of my Approach

Aside from the benefits discussed above, chosing to investigate biological mechanisms and disease through the lens of a single signaling pathway imposes some difficulties in research. It is common that mechanisms contributing to the pathology of a disease span indiscriminately across signaling pathways. We found this to be the case in our investigation of melanoma, presented in chapter 2 of this thesis and in follow up studies, where ERK signaling and Wnt signaling both play crucial roles in cell proliferation and survival [@biechele2012wnt]. A major facet of cancer is its ability to adapt to unfavorable environments, and thus it is not surprising that tumors frequently develop insensitivity to drugs targeting specific pathways [@Hutchinson_2014].

In contrast to the positive aspects of prioritizing discovery of small molecules, I found that this restricted the number possible solutions that could be utilized to solve the problems that I faced in my research. In trying to determine the mechanisms connecting the targets of riluzole and simvastatin with the Wnt pathway, I came up short. With Riluzole, we found convincing evidence that its effect on Wnt was due to inhibition of metabotropic glutamate receptors, but we could not fully resolve this using other known small molecule inhibitors of the pathway. In our investigation of Wiki4 presented in chapter 3 of this thesis, we identified the mechanism in large part because a molecule with a similar mechanism of Tankyrase inhibition had recently been reported [@Huang_2009]. In the case of the simvastatin, I was able to confirm that the effect on Wnt was due to inhibition of its known target HMGCR, but when I attempted to trace the steps back to Wnt signaling I could not successfully connect the dots with small molecules alone.

As is discussed throughout this thesis, I relied heavily on HTS as an initial discovery step in my inquiries. I found throughout the course of my studies that there is a finite limit to the utility of this approach, and that there are certain downsides that apply to the use of this method in an academic settings. The nature of secondary followup of high throughput screens involves repetitve work that is absent forward movement or intellectual consideration of results. This is not a problem in a commercial setting, but in an academic lab this often runs counter to the aspirations of the individual conducting experiments. Graduate students and post-docs seek to learn the skills of how to best ask questions based on interpretations results, and how to formulate methods to inquire and answer those questions. Manually grinding through lists of results in order to move to the next step in a research project does not work these muscles.

Finally, in cases where a single experiment represents a major portion of lab resources, the challenges of resource management are amplified. The chapters in this thesis demonstrate that just as a single screen can spawn multiple projects leading to publications, it can also happen that multiple screens lead to projects yielding zero publications. 



## 5.4 - Suggestions for Future Work

### 5.4.1 - Automate Wherever Possible

Although I've outlined above some of the potential pitfalls of relying on large screening campaigns in academic labs, I maintain that automation is currently underutilized. With regards to methods, I found that automation was incredible helpful in many aspects of this paper. This was not limited to the use of HTS. In the development and optimization of assays with primary aNPCs, I used automated microscopy to test many conditions. Since I was working with a primary cell lines, the culture conditions were not predifined. In order to determine the correct coating to keep the cells on the plate, timing to keep the cells alive, etc, the use of automated microscopy and scoring was a major boon. Certainly a graduate student should be expected to spend a great deal of labor, but if they can spend this on convering more ground, as opposed to single monolithic task, then they can better cover what is expected in a scientific report or journal article. This equipment will continue to become less expensive to own and operate, and thus should be readily adopted. Also, core facilities may aid in this.

### 5.4.2 - Expand beyond the pathway paradigm

Cell signaling pthways have allowed us to discover a lot of therapies
     The knowledge that we have acquired about how signaling molecules act upon one another is still extremely valuable, but we should view the system as an interconnected network rather than a series of pathways.

but they are showing signs of aging
    Signaling pathways were discovered based on their ability to produce visible morphological phenotypes in model organisms.

instead we need to expand our scope and include our knowledge of cell signaling as a subset of all observed phenomena describing cells
    In the past we aknowledged the phenomenon of cross talk, but this should be considered the norm.


this may allow us to avoid biases that have stood in the way of discovering effective therapies
    Cancer research has shown that thinking strictly by pathway is not helpful when developing therapeutics. Cancers will find a way around road blocks
    inhbitors are not as specific as we thought they were.

### 5.4.3 - Redifine the framework of academic Collaboration 

make collaboration compatible with automation, holistic, and omic approaches

It's particularly hard to connect those on the forefront of disease biology and those who have technical skills needed for automation. 

The current journal publication and authorship model does not offer the correct set of incentives for these wide collaborations.

embrace the trend of large cross-disciplanary experiments, come up with a way to distribute credit fairly to those involved in order to better incentivise experts to work with one another

Academic labs would benefit from the ability to quickly share assays, protocol, and libraries. Don't need to re-invent the wheel, can focus on particular area of expertise
