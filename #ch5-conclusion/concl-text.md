The concluding chapter should show clearly how the preceding chapters form 
a coherent substantial body of work and how significantly this body of work advances our knowledge.

#### Summarize overall results

I chose to frame my work on cell signaling pathways based on recent work.

My contribution of original knowledge in this area is the discovery of various molecules that can be used to manipulate Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling. This includes repurposed clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, and novel compounds whose biological mechanisms were later determined. 

#### Successes

There was a lot to be gained by focusing on Wnt signaling
    We had a great reporter system that could reliably be used for high throughput screening, also other reagents like antibodies, and most importantly expertise of peers in academic lab environment

    We were able to cover a lot of ground in terms of interesting disease contexts, as this became our pivot point

We delivered a number of molecules to the community
    These can be used immediately by clinicians
    body of knowledge that can be applied to interpretation of patient data

    and also can be used by biologists as research molecules
    can be purchased on tocris

We prototyped a system for HTS that worked in diverse cell types
    


#### Shortcomings

Possible shortcoming: block one pathway and cancer will find a way around it

While at times the self imposed filter of small molecules was helpful, it also restricted the possible solutions that could be found for a problem

Likewise with Wnt signaling, aside from the gains of tying a research project to a particular pathway, its likely that disease pathologies span indescriminately across signaling pathways. It may be more beneficial in some cases to consider all signaling pathways simultaneously, as is the case in systems biology, as opposed to 'monolithic' focus on a known pathway.

A shortcoming of my work with small molecules was my relative inability to determine novel targets. With Riluzole, we were fairly certain that the effect was due to metabotropic glutamate receptor, but there was conflicting data. In the case of the WIKI paper, Ricker worked for a long time and barely found it -- and it was already known. In the case of the simvatin, I was able to confirm that the effect on Wnt was due to simvas known MOA, but when I attempted to trace the steps back to Wnt signaling I could not succesfully connect the dots with small molecules alone.

Although I gave some attempt at using genetic and proteomic approaches, these did not yield an answer. I believe that if I had focused more strongly on possessing the correct genetic and proteomic tools to monitor and manipulate Wnt signaling I could have learned the answer -- and would be more suited to answer future questions.

Despite the effort put forth to do HTS in stem cells, we did not identify anything unique to stem cells when we did these screens. Wiki works in other cell types, as do the peptide mimetics that I identified. We hoped to learn about a possible interaction between CTNNB1 and OCT4, but only in traditional low-throughput experiments was our lab able to address these questions. The mistake here was to perform a wholistic discovery experiment with an anticipated result in mind -- these two approaches are not compatible.

#### Suggestions for future work

Determine whether wnt enhancement can truly overcome vemurafinib resistance

Closely follow clinical paradigms -- if something aside from small molecules comes along, then quickly adopt it to research

Prioritize performing experiments from different domains in tandem. In order to build a strong case that a certain signaling event occurs, I found that it is not only necessary to use small molecule perturbation but also through genetic means such as siRNA.
