The concluding chapter should show clearly how the preceding chapters form 
a coherent substantial body of work and how significantly this body of work advances our knowledge.

By examining the successes and failures 

I chose to frame my work on cell signaling pathways based on recent work.

My contribution of original knowledge in this area is the discovery of various molecules that can be used to manipulate Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling. This includes repurposed clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, and novel compounds whose biological mechanisms were later determined.
