<!-- What is the Problem -->
The flow of information through cell signaling pathways is central to an organism's livelyhood. A disruption in cell signaling, caused by a gene mutation or environmental factor, influences cell behavior in a way that can precipitate diseases like cancer and neurodegenertion. It stands to reason that if we can monitor and influence signaling events with sufficient resolution, we will be able to revert cells back to a healthy state and even regenerate damaged tissues. In order to accomplish this goal, we must posess both a thorough understanding of endogenous cell signaling pathways, and a practical toolkit for performing therapeutic intervention. <!-- Consider Changing 'therapeutic intervention' to 'perturbation' -->

<!-- Why is the problem hard? -->
While significant technical advances over the last decade yielded speculation of a coming wave of rationally targetted therapies, the contemporary landscape in therapeutics remains overwhelmingly populated by classes of molecules that long pre-date modern genomics and proteomics. A number of significant hurdles stand in the way of our complete comprehension and control of cell signaling:

1. The massive diversity in signaling molecules present in cells causes a 'needle in the haystack' problem for finding those responsible for a particular mechanism.
2. The intertwined nature of signaling pathways impedes our ability to study a single pathway in isolation.
3.
