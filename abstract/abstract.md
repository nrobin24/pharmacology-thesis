* Abstract
** What is the problem?

The flow of information through cell signaling pathways is central to an organism's livelyhood. A disruption in cell signaling, caused by a gene mutation or environmental factor, influences cell behavior in a way that can precipitate diseases like cancer and neurodegenertion. It stands to reason that if we can monitor and influence signaling events with sufficient resolution, we will be able to revert cells back to a healthy state and even regenerate damaged tissues. In order to accomplish these goals, we must posess both a thorough understanding of endogenous cell signaling pathways, and a practical toolkit for performing therapeutic intervention.

** Why is the problem hard?

A number of significant hurdles stand in the way of our complete comprehension and control of cell signaling. While significant technical advances over the last decade yielded speculation of a coming wave of rationally designed therapies, the current landscape in therapeutics remains overwhelmingly populated by

The flow of information through cell signaling networks is central to tissue development, wound healing, and maintenance of homeostasis during adulthood. A disruption in the network, by gene mutation or environmental factors, may  influence cell behavior in a way that precipitates disease. 


Human/rational designed therapies employing pharmacological control over cell signaling networks holds immense promise 


We do not understand how to control Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin signaling.


Diseases are killing us.

We do not know how to precisely control the behavior of cells.

We need to find regulators of cell signaling.
