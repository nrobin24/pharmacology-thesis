This section should outline the general theme and the objectives.

and should also warn a reader of any overlap in the article chapters, such as in the literature reviews or the methods 
section of each article.



General Theme
-------------

Cell signaling

Discovering biological regulators

Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin signaling

Stem and progenitor cells

Hight throughput screening / Automation

Small molecules

Objectives
----------

Elucidate the role of signaling pathways in governing stem cell behaviors like differentiation and programmed death.

Identify opportunites where perturbation of cell signaling in stem and progenitor cells may inform the development of a rational therapeutic.

Discover molecular regulators of key signaling events with applications to both basic research and clinical drug development.
