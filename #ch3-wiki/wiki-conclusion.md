## 3.3 - Conclusion

As aluded to in the introduction of this chapter, the screen in which Wiki4 was discovered was one amongst many screens that we had performed using a similar set of conditions. Here we utilized A375 melanoma cells for the primary screen, and we then looked to see whether hit compounds had activity in the H1 hESC line. 


In addition to the small molecule screen reported on here, we also screened libraries of siRNAs. Further, we attempted to learn about the mechanisms of small molecule regulators of Wnt signaling by  
As mentioned in chapter 1, reports have conflicted as to the precise role of canonical Wnt signaling in hESC self renewal and differentiation. 

* we were interested in h1 because we wanted to find oct4 interaction w ctnnb1
* we went on to do screens in h1s. it took a lot of work and I developed new protocols, see appendix A, 
* however this did not yield anything

* among the other types of screens that we conducted were modifier screens. I personally put a lot of effort into optimizing and qc'ing these screens.
* We did a modifier screen with braf inhibitor which helped support the biechele BRAF paper. I did modifier screen with simvastatin, but this did not end up yielding any interesting results.
* We tried a lot of different types of screening strategies, but the non-fancy screen is the one that ended up yielding the publication. 

While we hoped to discover novel biology with this screen, it turns out that wiki seems to have the same mechanism of action as XAV, which had recently been reported. However, Wiki still may be of some utility because it is structurally distinct from Xav.
