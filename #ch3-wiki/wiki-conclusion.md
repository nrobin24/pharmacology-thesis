## 3.3 - Conclusion

We learned some interesting things about wiki.

We found that Wiki reliably inhibited Wnt signaling in cancer cell lines and hESCs. 

The hESC finding was particularly interesting, as it confirmed an earlier finding from the lab that was fairly controversial: that canonical Wnt signaling is dispensible for the maintenance of undifferentiated cells.

Some groups had reported the opposite, but this was based on mouse cells.

There weren't that many ways to inhibit wnt signaling in these cells. Transduction with any siRNA would cause spontaneous differentiation, for instance. So, with Wiki alongside XAV and Pyrvinium, we were able to confirm our earlier finding.

While we hoped to discover novel biology with this screen, it turns out that wiki seems to have the same mechanism of action as XAV, which had recently been reported. However, Wiki still may be of some utility because it is structurally distinct from Xav.
