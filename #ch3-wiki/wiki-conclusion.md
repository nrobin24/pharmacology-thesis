## 3.3 - Conclusion

We tried a lot of different types of screening strategies, but the non-fancy screen is the one that ended up yielding the publication. We extensively tested the idea of modifier screening, which went on to be published in the BRAF paper but in general was not very informative.

This project yielded a novel inhibitor of the Wnt pathway reliably inhibited Wnt signaling in cancer cell lines and hESCs. Authors James and Bosch were able to connect with a


We learned some interesting things about wiki.

We found that Wiki 

The hESC finding was particularly interesting, as it confirmed an earlier finding from the lab that was fairly controversial: that canonical Wnt signaling is dispensible for the maintenance of undifferentiated cells.

Some groups had reported the opposite, but this was based on mouse cells.

There weren't that many ways to inhibit wnt signaling in these cells. Transduction with any siRNA would cause spontaneous differentiation, for instance. So, with Wiki alongside XAV and Pyrvinium, we were able to confirm our earlier finding.

While we hoped to discover novel biology with this screen, it turns out that wiki seems to have the same mechanism of action as XAV, which had recently been reported. However, Wiki still may be of some utility because it is structurally distinct from Xav.

As noted in the introduction of this chapter, the screen which yielded Wiki4  was one in a series of screens that were performed. Here we utilized A375 melanoma cells for the primary screen, and we then looked to see whether hit compounds had activity in the H1 hESC line. Subsequently we developed the ability to perform primary screens using H1 cells. These methods were used
