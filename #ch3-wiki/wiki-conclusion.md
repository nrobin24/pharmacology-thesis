## 3.3 - Conclusion

As aluded to in the introduction of this chapter, the screen in which Wiki4 was discovered was one amongst many screens that we had performed using a similar set of conditions. Here we utilized A375 melanoma cells for the primary screen, and we then looked to see whether hit compounds had activity in the H1 hESC line. As mentioned in chapter 1, reports have conflicted as to the precise role of canonical Wnt signaling in hESC self renewal and differentiation. 


This project was succesful in that it yielded a novel inhibitor of the Wnt pathway reliably inhibited Wnt signaling in cancer cell lines and hESCs. 

While we hoped to discover novel biology with this screen, it turns out that wiki seems to have the same mechanism of action as XAV, which had recently been reported. However, Wiki still may be of some utility because it is structurally distinct from Xav.

Subsequently we developed the ability to perform primary screens using H1 cells. 

In addition to the small molecule screen reported on here, we also screened libraries of siRNAs. Further, we attempted to learn about the mechanisms of small molecule regulators of Wnt signaling by  

We tried a lot of different types of screening strategies, but the non-fancy screen is the one that ended up yielding the publication. We extensively tested the idea of modifier screening, which went on to be published in the BRAF paper but in general was not very informative.

There weren't that many ways to inhibit wnt signaling in these cells. Transduction with any siRNA would cause spontaneous differentiation, for instance. So, with Wiki alongside XAV and Pyrvinium, we were able to confirm our earlier finding.
