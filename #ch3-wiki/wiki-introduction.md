## 3.1 - Introduction

In addition to identifying enhancers, I was also interested in identifying molecules that had an inhibitory effect on the pathway. The reason for this interest was to:
* use in directed differentiation protocols in hESCs
* use as a research tool instead of siRNA, or in vivo mouse exps


The opening of the Quellos High Throughput Screening Facility at the University of Washington campus in South Lake Union enabled the Moon Lab to better develop and optimize assays, cell lines, and treatment protocols towards their use in high throughput screens.



As opposed to the screen conducted at the Broad which used human experienced compounds, I performed a screen using the Kinaset library which was combinatorially assembled. The molecules in the library were supposed to match the shape of the ATP binding pocket in kinases, this is the scaffold that the molecules were based on.

We thought that this might work better than the human experienced compounds, as relatively few showed statistically significant inhibition
