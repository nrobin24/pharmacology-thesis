<!-- cursory description of the work and its motivation -->
Subsequent to my participation in the riluzole project, I worked in collaboration with others in the Moon lab to discover additional small molecule regulators of the Wnt pathway. The opening of the Quellos High Throughput Screening Facility at the University of Washington enabled our group to prototype and perform a series of screens. One such screen utilized a library of ~7,000 small molecules that were selected for the presence of pharmacophores that may interact with the ATP ligand site of kinases[@Chembridge]. So, although this library was made up of compounds that had not been previously tested for biological activity, it was thought that hit compounds would likely function through inhibition of kinases. As in other screens, we used the pBAR construct as our primary assay in order to identify compounds with either an activating or inhibiting effect on the Wnt pathway.

We were particularly interested in identifying kinase inhibitors that 

The existence of methods to identify molecular target and subsequent mechanism linking a kinase to the Wnt pathway. We also had performed screens using siRNAs that targeted each kinase individually, and we hoped to be able to relate the results of these screens to one another.

We performed secondary validation on dozens of compounds that showed an effect of either activation or inhibition. Ultimately it was decided that

In addition to identifying enhancers, I was also interested in identifying molecules that had an inhibitory effect on the pathway. The reason for this interest was to:
* use in directed differentiation protocols in hESCs
* use as a research tool instead of siRNA, or in vivo mouse exps

 the Moon Lab to better develop and optimize assays, cell lines, and treatment protocols towards their use in high throughput screens.
