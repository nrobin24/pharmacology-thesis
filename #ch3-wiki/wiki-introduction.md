## 3.1 - Introduction

Subsequent to my participation in the riluzole investigaton, I worked in collaboration with others in the Moon lab to discover additional small molecule regulators of the Wnt pathway. The opening of the Quellos High Throughput Screening Facility at the University of Washington enabled our group to prototype and perform our own series of screens. 

One such screen utilized a library of ~7,000 small molecules that were selected based on the presence of pharmacophores predicted to interact with the ATP binding pocket of protein kinases [@Chembridge]. So, although this library was made up of compounds that had not been previously tested for biological activity, it was thought that hit compounds would likely function through inhibition of kinases. As in other screens, we used the pBAR construct as our primary assay in order to identify compounds with either an activating or inhibiting effect on the Wnt pathway.

The Moon lab's interest in identifying kinase inhibitors that regulate Wnt signaling related to complimentary studies which were concurrently underway in the lab. Within the time-period of the study presented in this chapter, we had run screens of pBAR cell lines using multiple siRNA libraries which targeting all individual kinases. We also subjected these same cell lines to mass-spectrometry based quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis under a variety of conditions. Thus, we had gathered a sizeable amount of data describing kinase regulation of the pathway.

Given the importance of regulating Wnt in directed differentiation protocols of hESCs (see introduction), we sought to identify small molecules that could inhibit Wnt in these cells. We also wanted to address the lack of available molecules with the potential to inhibit Wnt in animal models. This instructed our decision to follow the molecule Wiki4 through the course of this investigation.
