## 2.1 - Introduction

<!-- cursory description of the work and its motivation -->
Upon joining the Moon lab, I began to analyze a dataset that came as a result of a high-throughput small molecule screen. This screen was performed by lab members Travis Biechele and Nathan Camp, in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Haggerty of the Broad Institute. The screen was conducted using a cell line that had been lentivirally transduced with the pBAR-Luciferase construct, a robust genetic reporter of ß-Catenin signaling. The motivation for this screen came, in part, from findings by Dr. Andy Chien's group that enhanced Wnt/ß-catenin signaling correlates with improved outcome among melanoma patients.

<!-- detailed motivation about the part i was involved in -->
The library of molecules had been assembled Broad Institute and included ~2,000 compounds that previously been approved for human use in the United States, Canada, or the European Union. The intention in including human-experienced compounds in the screen was twofold. First, in pursuit of compounds that are clinically feasible there is typically a high rate of attrition in the steps between HTS discovery and generation of lead compounds [@bleicher2003hit]. Biechele and Camp looked to avoid this by focusing on compounds that already had proven efficacy in humans. Second, these human-experienced compounds had been well researched prior to their use in the screen, meaning that hits could often be matched with known mechanisms of action.

<!-- the problem that I needed to address -->
While the Broad Institute provided the facilities for Biechele and Camp to conduct the physical screen, the Moon lab was left to its own devices in analyzing of the resultant data. We also needed to formulate a plan for hit prioritization, and secondary follow up validation. We sought to prioritize these processes based upon the goal of identifying compounds that enhance Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling and which may be of therapeutic value in treating melanoma.

My work in this project was largely focused in answering the questions of:

* how do you analyze a high throughput screen
* how many compounds to try and validate
* when to throw out a compound

<!-- my approach to answering the question -->
My approach was:

* Test multiple doses
* Use RT-PCR
