<!-- sets the context and draws out the overall implications of the work -->

^ Your assumptions – yes, every one of them
^ Your limitations – yes, every one of them
^ Requirements of your solution/approach – both mandatory and optional 
^ Constraints under which your solution will work
^ Above all, why these assumptions, limitations, requirements & constraints
^ A concrete validation plan for your hypothesis – experiments, simulation, 
theorems, proofs, etc. 
^ Scope – what’s part of your thesis and what is definitely not 

# Context


### Considerations

We were looking for interesting things to follow up.

More prior knowledge about a compounds mechanism was considered more interesting.

We needed to see activation in mutliple readouts.

## My contributions

### Figure 1A: Primary Screen analysis

### Result Summary

A human-experienced collection of chemicals was screened in HT22 cells stably expressing BAR for enhancers of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We identified 47 (44 unique) chemicals that enhanced the WNT3A stimulus greater than 1.5-fold.

### Explanation of my Role

* developed plan to connect and process data
- aimed at maximizing our effectiveness in prioritizing hits
- Convert raw data to human interpretable readout
- sort across various drug agencies (FDA, euro, world)
- perform statistical analysis in HTS (Z Score)
- manually curate results, resolve replicates from multiple libraries
