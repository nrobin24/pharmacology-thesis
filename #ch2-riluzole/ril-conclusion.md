## 2.3 - Conclusion

Our publication identifying riluzole as a Wnt enhancer in melanoma resulted from a succesful implementation of a high throughput screening campaign followed by thorough validation and analysis of mechanism. We were able to re-use this pattern in later projects, as seen in the proceeding chapters.

Typical for high throughput workflows, there was a high level of attrition between each filtering step. This meant that a great deal of the effort that I spent validating compounds did not end up contributing to the publication. This ramifications of this may be better accepted in commercial settings, where HTS had been used far more extensively than in academic biology labs. Having undergone the experience, I was able to form a perspective about the ideal ratio of effort to spend at each step of the workflow, which I carried on to later projects.

We attempted to use siRNAs as well as additional small molecules directed at effectors proximal to GRM1 in order to pinpoint the link between this receptor and Wnt signaling. However, the results of these experiments were not entirely consistent. Unfortunately we did not come away from our investigation of riluzole with a clear understanding of how GRM1 inhibition feeds into the Wnt pathway. This came as a surprise, as we had chosen to focus on hit compounds with known targets particularly to aid in elucidation mechanism.

An upside to our use of HTS, was that this primary screen was able to seed multiple investigations of interesting compounds. In addition to riluzole, in this screen we identified statins as enhancers of the Wnt pathway. This is covered in chapter 4 of this thesis.
