## 2.3 - Conclusion


We succesfully followed the pattern from hit to lead.

From secondary validation I took away lessons about the ideal ratio of effort to spend on this step, which I carried on to later projects.

There was a high level of attrition along the way and a lot of work that went into validating compounds that did not make the final cut. It's unclear whether this is an ideal situation in an academic lab. Whereas in a

We did not come away with a clear understanding of the mechanism of how GRM1 receptor feeds back into Wnt signaling.

In addition to what was published, we were able to use other hits, most notably simvastatin which is covered in Chapter 4.

The results and follow-up experiments from this screen yielded not only the publication covered in this chapter regarding riluzole, but also
