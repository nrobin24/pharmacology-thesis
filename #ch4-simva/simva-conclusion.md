## 4.3 - Conclusion

The simvastatin study achieved the goals that I set out with, because I went from hit discovery, through secondary followup, and on to an in vivo model. In addition, we were able to learn a bit about how the mechanism of statins connects to Wnt signaling.

There were a number of problems:

I tested statins in healthy animals and not in a disease state. This was because in consulting with Bryan White and Phil Horner, I found that the experiments I was going to need to do in order to test simva in an in vivo disease model were outside the scope of what I was going to be able to accomplish in a reasonable amount of time. While it is still interesting to look at adult neurogenesis in a healthy animal, I wasn't able to determine wheteher the effectsof simvastatin on wnt signaling were able to rescue any disease phenotypes. It would have been itneresting to look at a traumatic brain injury model, but based on the data that had been gathered from Bryan White's previous study, it seemed that the number of mice I would have to treat would have been infeasible.

In the review process, reviewers complained that my findings were incremental. This came form the fact that I was trying to tie together two different ideas, each which were somewhat novel but not entirely new. My work showed for the first time what simvastatin enhances Wnt signaling in vivo, and I demonstrated a biological effect of this enhancement on neurogenesis. However it had previously been demonstrated in cell culture models that simvastatin enhances Wnt signaling. Also, a number of papers had shown neurological effects of statins.

I still believe that the findings of my paper were significant and contributed important new knowledge to the field for the following reasons. Meta analyses such as the 2012 paper continue to show that people who take statins are less likely to develop dementia. As we do not possess a clear understanding yet of the mechanisms that are responsible, there remains a demand for investigation into these mechanisms.

I think that a shortcoming that I wish I could have overcome was: I was not able to look globally at signaling since I did not posess all of the right tools. I had the Wnt reporter mouse, with which I could surface the finding that simvastatin enhances Wnt in vivo. However, it could have been more revealing to put this finding in the context of other pathways that are both known to be important in adult neurogenesis, as well as pathways that are known to be affected by simvastatin.

With regards to methods, I found that automation was incredible helpful in many aspects of this paper. First there was the high throughput screen, which has been covered in this thesis. In the development and optimization of assays with primary aNPCs, I used automated microscopy to test many conditions. Since I was working with a primary cell lines, the culture conditions were not predifined. In order to determine the correct coating to keep the cells on the plate, timing to keep the cells alive, etc, the use of automated microscopy and scoring was a major boon.

Certainly a graduate student should be expected to spend a great deal of labor, but if they can spend this on convering more ground, as opposed to single monolithic task, then they can better cover what is expected in a scientific report or journal article. 

A notable exception was that there was still a great deal of manual work that I had to conduct, particularly with processing mouse brain tissue and making slides.
