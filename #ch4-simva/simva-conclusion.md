## 4.3 - Conclusion

This study, investigating whether simvastatin can enhance Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in the adult brain, is another example implementation of the research pattern that I have outlined throughout this thesis. I surfaced statins as an interesting hit from a primary screen, took the compounds through secondary validation, and investigated the biological effect in an in vivo model. Finally, I was able to make inroads to learning the mechanism of how statin inhibition of HMGCR connects to Wnt signaling.

Prior to conducting the in vivo experiments presented in this paper, I was most interested to see whether simvastatin could rescue deleterious phenotypes in a model of neurological disease. I sought advice on this subject from a former Moon lab member, Bryan White, and a collaborator of the lab, Phillip Horner, who had undertaken an investigation of Wnt signaling in traumatic brain injury (TBI) [@White_2010]. I was informed of the within-group noise in the experimental results that White acquired. This was attributed to the inconsistent response between animals in this TBI model. A power analysis using White's variability numbers revealed that if I were to conduct a 4 group study testing each combination of simvastatin, injury, and controls, I would need a prohibitively large number of mice in order to reach statistical significance. Therefore, in order to stay within the scope of time, cost, and my own capabilities as a graduate student, I conducted the study with healthy adult mice, as opposed to a disease model.

In the submission process for this article, I fielded complaints from reviewers that my findings were incremental. This was based in the fact that I was trying to tie together two different ideas, each which were somewhat novel but not entirely new. It had previously been demonstrated in cell culture models that simvastatin enhances Wnt signaling. Also, a number of papers had shown neurological effects of statins. However in spite of what is already known, it remains that we do not possess a clear understanding of the mechanisms explaining reported neurological benefits of statins. My work showed for the first time that simvastatin enhances Wnt signaling _in vivo_ and demonstrated a biological effect of this enhancement on neurogenesis, and thus contributed important new knowledge to the field.
