## 4.3 - Conclusion

This study, investigating whether simvastatin can enhance Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin signaling in the adult brain, was another example of the pattern that I set forth with. I went from hit discovery, through secondary followup, and on to an in vivo model. In addition, we were able to learn a bit about how the mechanism of statins connects to Wnt signaling.

I tested statins in healthy animals and not in a disease state. This was because in consulting with Bryan White and Phil Horner, I found that the experiments I was going to need to do in order to test simva in an in vivo disease model were outside the scope of what I was going to be able to accomplish in a reasonable amount of time. While it is still interesting to look at adult neurogenesis in a healthy animal, I wasn't able to determine wheteher the effectsof simvastatin on wnt signaling were able to rescue any disease phenotypes. It would have been itneresting to look at a traumatic brain injury model, but based on the data that had been gathered from Bryan White's previous study, it seemed that the number of mice I would have to treat would have been infeasible.

In the review process, reviewers complained that my findings were incremental. This came form the fact that I was trying to tie together two different ideas, each which were somewhat novel but not entirely new. My work showed for the first time what simvastatin enhances Wnt signaling in vivo, and I demonstrated a biological effect of this enhancement on neurogenesis. However it had previously been demonstrated in cell culture models that simvastatin enhances Wnt signaling. Also, a number of papers had shown neurological effects of statins.

I still believe that the findings of my paper were significant and contributed important new knowledge to the field for the following reasons. Meta analyses such as the 2012 paper continue to show that people who take statins are less likely to develop dementia. As we do not possess a clear understanding yet of the mechanisms that are responsible, there remains a demand for investigation into these mechanisms.

I think that a shortcoming that I wish I could have overcome was: I was not able to look globally at signaling since I did not posess all of the right tools. I had the Wnt reporter mouse, with which I could surface the finding that simvastatin enhances Wnt in vivo. However, it could have been more revealing to put this finding in the context of other pathways that are both known to be important in adult neurogenesis, as well as pathways that are known to be affected by simvastatin.
