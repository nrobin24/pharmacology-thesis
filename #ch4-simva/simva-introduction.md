## 4.1 - Introduction

The simvastatin paper was another project that was based on the small molecule screen performed at the Broad Institute by Biechele and Camp.

I performed secondary followup validation on many of the hits from the primary screen. Part of my filtering process involved manual curation based on the interest in the compound and what was known in the literature.

I found statins especially interesting. This is because it is one of the most prescribed class of drugs, and have generally little side effects. Also there is a lot known about the mechanism of action, so I felt that I had a good starting place to go from.

I initially looked into simvastatin in many contexts including melanoma and hESCs, both of which showed enhancement of the pathway. However I ended up chosing to stick with neural context. Simva had already been under investigation for potentially beneficial role in neurological disorders. 

I was most interested in looking at the context of traumatic brain injury. However based upon talks with Bryan White, who had just published a paper from the Moon lab about TBI, it did not seem feasible to start with this paradigm immediately. This is because the injury model in use was very noisy, and even without drug treatment there was a huge variability between groups. In consideration of time, I performed these experiments with healthy animals.
