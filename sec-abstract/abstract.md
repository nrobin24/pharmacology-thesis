<!-- What is the Problem -->
The flow of information through signaling pathways in stem and progenitor cells triggers events such as proliferation, differentation, and programmed cell death. A disruption in signaling, as can caused by a gene mutation or environmental factor, influences cell behavior in a way that can precipitate diseases like cancer and neurodegenertion. It stands to reason that if we can monitor and influence signaling events in stem and progenitor cells with sufficient resolution, we will be able to counter the effects of such diseases. Significant technical advances over the last decade in our ability to monitor and control cell state has yielded speculation of a coming wave of rational and targetted therapies. However, the landscape of therapeutics in use today is populated overwhelmingly by classes of molecules that long pre-date the modern era of genomics and proteomics focused research.

<!-- Why is the problem hard? -->

There are many contexts:
* Melanoma Cancer Stem Cells
* Human Embryonic Stem Cells
* Adult Neural Progenitor Cells


<!-- What is your approach/result to solving this problem? -->

Focus on Wnt/ÃŸ-Catenin signaling.
* turns out to be key regulator in many interesting stem cell contexts
* restriction which gives individual projects a constraint in scope can turn out to be beneficial
* practical ramifications, in house domain expertise in both perturbation and measurement of the pathway

Use of automated data acquisition and analysis.
* applies to both discovery of mechanism and generation of therapeutic leads
* unbiased approaches overcome pain-points inherent to studying cell-signaling
* work within thesis is proof-of-concept that high throughput techniques can be adapted to difficult to culture cell-types such as hESCs and aNPCs


Generation of therapeutic leads by screening libraries of molecules

Omic analysis of complex phenotypes to investigate cell mechanisms

Considering stem cells as populations
<!-- What is the consequence of your approach? -->

As a result of this research we were able to:
* Identify multiple disease mechanisms centered around Wnt misregulation
* Repurpose mutliple FDA approved drugs to modulate Wnt signaling in manners that have therapeutic relevance
