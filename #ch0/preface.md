# Preface

To date, the field of translational life sciences has made major headway towards development of therapies that utilize pharmacologic manipulation of stem and progenitor cells. We know in large part where stem and progenitor cell niches reside within adult organisms. We have identified cases where these niches contribute to homeostasis or disease depending on their environment. We've identified sets of markers that reliably indicate where a cell lies within the spectrum between pleuripotency and terminal differentiation, and this information can be used to determine the fate decisions that a cell has made in its lifetime. These advances have greatly impacted our understanding of the mechanisms by which misregulation of signaling in stem cells contributes to disease.

Additionally, the field possesses an increasingly rich understanding of how stem cells may manipulated to generate desired cell types, and conversely how to induce differentiated cells to gain pleuripotent capibility. 

<!-- However, a survey of

My contribution of original knowledge in this area is the discovery of various molecules that can be used to manipulate Wnt/ß-Catenin signaling. This includes repurposed clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, and novel compounds whose biological mechanisms were later determined. In efforts to drive discovery, I tested and honed a set of methodologies that can be used to perform automated and high-throughput experiments in stem and progenitor cells. To direct discovery towards clinical relevance, I designed and iterated upon a pipeline to perform primary data filtering, secondary validation, and ultimately to test discoveries in clinically revelant disease models.

By conducting high throughput screens of arrayed small molecule libraries, using stem and progenitor cell lines that have been engineered to encapsulate genetic reporter systems, it has been possible to identify clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, as well as entirely novel Wnt regulators whose biological mechanisms were later determined.
