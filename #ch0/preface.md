# Preface

I conducted the research presented in this thesis dissertation with the goal of elucidating how Wnt/ß-catenin signaling directs behavior in stem and progenitor cells. Within this realm, I chose to investigate contexts in which findings may inform novel therapeutics. To accomplish this, I worked within a framework 

Projects began with a high-throughput screen to discover molecules that regulate Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in decidedly interesting contexts. The molecules with the greatest activity in the screen are chosen as hits, and are fed into a pipeline of filtering and validation steps. Finally, I characterized the activity of the most promising molecules in a series of cell culture, animal, and disease models.

From project to project, which was iteratively improved upon. 

I looked to maximize the amount of usable information gathered, and to optimize relevance to disease using experimental models.



In efforts to drive discovery, I tested and honed a set of methodologies that can be used to perform automated and high-throughput experiments in stem and progenitor cells. To direct discovery towards clinical relevance, I designed and iterated upon a pipeline to perform primary data filtering, secondary validation, and ultimately to test discoveries in clinically relevant disease models.

By conducting high throughput screens of arrayed small molecule libraries, using stem and progenitor cell lines that have been engineered to encapsulate genetic reporter systems, it has been possible to identify clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, as well as entirely novel Wnt regulators whose biological mechanisms were later determined.
