# Preface

I conducted the research presented in this thesis dissertation with the goal of elucidating how Wnt/ÃŸ-catenin signaling directs behavior in stem and progenitor cells. Within this realm, I chose to investigate contexts in which findings may inform novel therapeutics. I selected three journal articles to include within this thesis, each directed towards this goal.

By conducting high throughput screens of arrayed small molecule libraries, using stem and progenitor cell lines that have been engineered to encapsulate genetic reporter systems, it has been possible to identify clinically-approved compounds that were not previously known to affect Wnt, as well as entirely novel Wnt regulators whose biological mechanisms were later determined.
