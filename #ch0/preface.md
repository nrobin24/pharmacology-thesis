# Preface

This thesis is an encapsulation of the research that I conducted over the last six years under the mentorship of Dr. Randall Moon. The goal of my graduate work was to elucidate how Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling directs behavior in stem and progenitor cells. Within this realm, I chose to investigate contexts in which findings may inform novel therapeutics. I selected three journal articles to include within this thesis, each directed towards this goal. My role in the first two papers was in the assay development, discovery, analysis, and hit validation steps. In the final paper, of which I am the primary author, I was responsible for making decisions in the direction of the project, and attempted to use guiding principals that I had established throughout my time in the Moon lab.
