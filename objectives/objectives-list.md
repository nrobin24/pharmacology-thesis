# Objectives

* Elucidate the role of signaling pathways in governing stem cell behaviors like differentiation and programmed death.

* Identify opportunites where perturbation of cell signaling in stem and progenitor cells may inform the development of a rational therapeutic.

* Discover molecular regulators of key signaling events with applications to both basic research and clinical drug development.
